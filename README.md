Moody Air Force Base, located in Lowndes County, Georgia, created this project with the goal of developing an easier, more efficient, and more reliable method for scheduling flights [and viewing flight schedules] at Moody (with a stretch goal of expanding the use of the software to other United States Air Force bases). The current software they use has proven unreliable (often the system is unavailable). They have resorted to entering data, which has been given to schedulers verbally, into static Excel sheets. This method is prone to clerical errors and is extremely time consuming.

Our goal is to provide a software solution that is easy to use and increases productivity; additionally, the software aids in preventing human, clerical errors.
